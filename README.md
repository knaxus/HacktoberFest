## Agenda

With respect to [this](https://twitter.com/vilvaathibanpb/status/1178483041615990786) tweet by **[Vilva](https://twitter.com/vilvaathibanpb)**

> As [@hacktoberfest](https://twitter.com/hacktoberfest) is approaching, @reeversedev, @ashokdey_ and I have decided to dedicate 30 hours each in the month to individually help 30 people each in their journey to open source. We will be spending one hour per person and it will be a remote session. 

We are pleased to announce that we have received a great response from developers all cross and we also got few more mentors. So here's what it's going to happen:

- We have around 85 entries. We will divide them across 7 of us so its approximately 12 per person
- We group them as set of 4 people per batch
- The grouping happens based on interests of people
- We show them the ways of OSS, like how we choose a repo, find an issue, raise a PR etc and how to start from simple stuff.
- And definitely not everyone will move forward, but those who do, we will re-group them and revisit them on ad-hoc basis and provide further support
- **Our role ends when their first PR gets merged**
